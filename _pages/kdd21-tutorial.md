## Abstract

Recent years have witnessed the enormous success of text representation learning in a wide range of text mining tasks. 
Earlier word embedding learning approaches represent words as fixed low-dimensional vectors to capture their semantics. The so learned word embeddings are then used as the input features of task-specific models.
Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) field, which learn universal language representations via pre-training Transformer-based neural models on large-scale text corpora.
Such pre-trained representations encode generic linguistic features that can be transferred to almost any text-related applications.
PLMs outperform previous task-specific models in many applications as they only need to be fine-tuned on the target corpus instead of being trained from scratch.

In this tutorial, we will introduce recent advances in pre-trained text embeddings and language models, as well as their applications to a wide range of text mining tasks.
Specifically, we first overview a set of recently developed self-supervised and weakly-supervised text embedding methods and pre-trained language models that serve as the fundamentals for downstream tasks. 
We then present several new methods based on pre-trained text embeddings and language models for various text mining applications such as topic discovery and text classification. We focus on methods that are weakly-supervised, domain-independent, language-agnostic, effective and scalable for mining and discovering structured knowledge from large-scale text corpora. 
We will demonstrate on real-world datasets how the pre-trained text representations help mitigate the human annotation burden and facilitate automatic, accurate and efficient text analyses.
