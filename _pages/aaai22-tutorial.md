## Abstract

This tutorial aims to introduce recent advances in pre-trained text embeddings and language models (e.g., BERT and GPT), as well as their applications to a wide range of text mining tasks. The audiences will be provided with a systematic introduction of (1) the development of pre-trained text representation learning, (2) how the pre-trained models effectively empower fundamental text mining applications and (3) new techniques and approaches to tame pre-trained text representations for text mining tasks with few human annotations.
Target audiences include any researchers and practitioners who are interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for natural language and data mining applications using state-of-the-art pre-trained language models. The audiences will learn not only the background and history of text representation learning and text mining, but also the most recent models and methods along with their applications. Our tutorial has a special focus on weakly-supervised methods in text mining which require minimal human efforts for model learning. We will also demonstrate with real-world datasets how pre-trained text representations help mitigate the human annotation burden and facilitate automatic, accurate and efficient text analyses.

The target audience includes typical practitioners of AI who might have a high-level idea about preference learning but are not typically aware of the various challenging facets of the problem. The novelty of the tutorial lies in translating the different paradigms across communities into the language of AI so that it will benefit the ML/AI community. The tutorial will be self-contained and does not expect any prerequisites. Audience with basic knowledge of AI/ML would be able to follow most of the material.
