I am a Ph.D. student in Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/)'s Data Mining Group ([DMG](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/)) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I obtained my M.S. degree and B.S. degree also at UIUC, in Computer Science and Computer Engineering respectively.

I am especially passionate about developing unsupervised and weakly-supervised (i.e., requires minimal human supervision) text mining techniques for organizing and exploring text data. As such, I work at the intersection of data mining, natural language processing and applied machine learning. In the long run, my research is dedicated to mining structured knowledge from large-scale text data in label-efficient ways.
